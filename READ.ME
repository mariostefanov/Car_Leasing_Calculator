I designed the car leasing calculor to be responsive by using HTML to structure the form and CSS flexbox for flexible layout, ensuring columns are side by side on desktops and one under other on mobile devices.I used media queries to adjust as needed for smaller screens, ensuring simple transition to single-column layout for mobile devices.I tested across devices to ensure a seamless user experiense.
